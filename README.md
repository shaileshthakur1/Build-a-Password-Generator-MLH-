# Build-a-Password-Generator-MLH

I have made a password generator using Python for the Global Hack Week Challenege of Day 3 at Major league Hacking. 

This wasn't supposed to be fullstack type an appplication. I practised what i learnt via MLH session. 

This is made in very basic way , you can take the reference from and may give it a try yourself.
